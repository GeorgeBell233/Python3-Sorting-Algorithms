# Python3-Sorting-Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms made in Python 3, part of portfolio
Currently made is a recursive Quicksort and BubbleSort as well as a function to generate random unsorted lists
To test this just set a variable name to the value of the random list generator and fill in the other arguments with numbers and then call the subroutine with the list as the argument (Quicksort may reach max recursive depth as I have not made it iterative yet)
